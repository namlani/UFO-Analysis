# UFO-Analysis

## Overview of Project
The purpose of this project is to provide an in-depth analysis of UFO sightings by allowing users to filter for multiple criteria at the same time. 

## Results
Filters were created to filter the data by city, state, country, and shape. The filters are labeled with examples populated by default to guide the user on how to use them, as shown in the following image:

## Summary
### Drawbacks
One drawback of this project is that the data is not live. It uses a static data file to populate the table.

### Recommendations
1. Implementing a live data feed would be useful for further development.
2. Adding a filter for the Duration will increase functionality.
